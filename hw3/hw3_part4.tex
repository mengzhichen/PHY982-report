\section{Extraction of spectroscopic factor}
As is normal, the spectroscopic factor is extracted by compare the theory to the data at the first peak in the angular distribution
\cite{PhysRevC.69.064313}, as we expect that the reaction is mostly direct at the forward angle. 
The spectroscopic factors at beam energies 2.84 MeV and 4.51 MeV are given in Table \ref{tab:spec}. 
The angle of first peak $\theta_{p}$ is given by the calculations in Sec. \ref{sec:post}, 
and $\sigma^{\mathrm{exp}}$ is obtained by interpolation of experimental data. 
The spectroscopic factors we extract are energy-dependent, 
which is expected because Ref. \cite{PhysRev.101.209} shows that $^{12}$C(d, p)$^{13}$C is more accurately modeled as a compound reaction at the beam energies we choose.

	$\theta_p$ is the angle of the first peak, and $\sigma^{\mathrm{exp}}$ and $\sigma^{\mathrm{DWBA}}$ are corresponding differential cross sections obtained from experimental data and post-form DWBA calculation, respectively. }
